# Mapping-Robot
School project, Robot powered by an Arduino.

This repository will contain all the ressources we will find and create to build our robot.

Research Subject : "How can the robot assist humains after a desaster"
Examples: Fukushima's nuclear disaster,
          Nepal's Earthquake in April 2015.

Here's a list of the components we will be using for this project (unfinished):
- Arduino mega 2560 Board.
- Motor Shield.
- 3 Ultrasonics sensors.
- 3 Infrared sensors.
- Bluetooth receiver/transmitter.
- 2 DC Motors, 2 Wheels.

During this project we will be making:
- An android app that will allowed the user to setup the robot and receive some informations. This informations will   be used to create a map of the robot environment.
- A robot powered by an arduino board, it will be able to avoid obstacles and send informations to the app for         further processing. 
- The robot script that will drive all the sensors and motors.

Every ressources that we've made are open source, you might use them without any conditions.
